I was born in Huanggang, Hubei, and grew up there receiving my secondary education. I spent wonderful undergraduate years at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. In my third undergraduate year, I went through a selective examen and was admitted to Université Paris-Sud in France for my graduate and doctoral studies. After Ph.D study, I followed my husband and spent two years in Berlin, and later, I worked at Huazhong University for nearly two years. Upon the recommendation of a French doctoral advisor, I came to Complutense University of Madrid in Spain to conduct postdoctoral research. I am currently residing in Madrid.
