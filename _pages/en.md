I was born in a picturesque small village nestled in the Qinling-Daba Mountains of China, and I grew up there. I spent wonderful undergraduate years at Tsinghua University, completed my doctoral studies in the romantic city, Paris, wandered in Berlin for two years, and then worked as an associate professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology for four years. After various journeys, I currently reside in Madrid.

Research
------
My expertise lies in the field of geometric measure theory, with a primary focus on the existence of Plateau problems and the regularity of minimal sets. The Plateau problem, originating in the 18th century, remained a profound challenge until the breakthroughs in the 20th century. It has evolved into a crucial discipline known as geometric measure theory. To this day, the existence of Plateau problems and the regularity of minimal sets remain central topics in geometric measure theory, with the majority still unresolved.
