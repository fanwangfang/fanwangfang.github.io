- DEC 2020-JUIN 2022:  Postdoc researcher in the Department of Physical Chemistry, University of Complutense (UCM), Madrid, Spain. Research topics: Ultrafast photonics for the design of new materials and efficient energy capture, under Prof. Luis Ba침ares.
> I have been working in the experimental research line of high harmonic generation for production of attosecond pulse trains and studies of molecular photoionization in the ultrafast time-scale with XUV radiation.
> I've made programming for motor control, data acquisition and data analysis including femtosecond multi-photon ionization mechanism of alkyliodide molecular in gas phase (including Freeman and Coulomb analysis).
> I was also in charge of the development of the complex time phase-retrieval algorithm for the RABBIT (reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions) in case of CEP not being stable.
   
- NOV 2017- Sep 2019:   Postdoc researcher and team leader in charge of the whole project including software and hardware development of 3D multimodal coherent Raman imaging and spectroscopy instrument. And co-author for different national project study and application (such as laser 3D micro-nano material and device processing, photo-acoustic and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument development) Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.
- APR 2010- SEP 2014:   Ph.D researcher for Ultrafast Nanoscale Coherent Imaging using ultrafast high harmonic beamline, in the Attophyiscs group,Laboratory of Interactions Dynamics and Lasers (LIDYL), CEA/CNRS/Universite패 Paris-Saclay, France 
> The aim of my PhD thesis was to demonstrate single shot 2D and 3D ability of ultrafast coherent diffractive imaging by using high harmonic generation (HHG) beamline.
> My responsibilities were to study the novel imaging algorithm and optimize the developed optical experimental set-up for the single shot coherent imaging experiment of home-made 2D and 3D micro/nanoscale sample.
